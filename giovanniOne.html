                <h1>My Story</h1><br>
                <p>Hailing from the vibrant city of Lagos, now residing in the green city of Telford,
                    Giovanni Kalu brings fresh energy, diversity, and enthusiasm to modelling,
                    specialising in commercial and high fashion. 
                </p><br>
                <p>He has a passion for storytelling and a strong artistic flair, which he demonstrates through imaginative,
                    detailed, and thoughtful presented artwork, in paper, poses, and movement. This stems from early
                    experiences in artistic and thematic performances at Peiramax limited campaign content videos, which was his major
                    foundational exposure to the world of modelling from age 5.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    He is excited to collaborate with creative teams and brands to bring compelling vision to life. You can see some of
                    his work in his portfolio below, which highlights his professionalism and growth.
